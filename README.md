# Project Idea

The idea behind this project was to:

1. Convert SQL to a Substrait plan with Calcite.
2. Execute the Substrait plan on different systems (e.g., DuckDB, DataFusion).

Students would then experiment with Calcite's different rules. However, this project idea didn't quite work for the following reasons:

1. `substrait-java` does not run optimizations - while in theory this can be enabled, I recall running into some issues.
2. More critically, at the time of writing, both DuckDB and DataFusion have limited support for executing the Substrait generated by Calcite.
